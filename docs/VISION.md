# **VISION DOCUMENT: Hustle Economy**

## **WHAT THIS GAME IS ABOUT**

**Remarkably realistic-feeling scenarios, realistic pressure from managing multiple priorities and commitments.**

The core of this game is creating emergent stories that feel true to life - the tension of managing work, relationships, ambition, and survival. Players should recognize themselves in the decisions: "Do I go to my girlfriend's birthday or take this high-paying shift?" "Do I risk it all for quick money or grind it out the safe way?" "Can I handle one more commitment without dropping all the others?"

The game doesn't judge these choices. It simply models the consequences with enough fidelity that players feel the weight of their decisions, both in the moment and weeks later when those choices come back to haunt or reward them.

---

## **CORE EXPERIENCE**

### **The Feeling We're Chasing:**

**Tension:**
- The anxiety of juggling too many things at once
- The constant awareness that you could get caught
- The split-second decision: "Do I risk it or play it safe?"
- The sinking feeling when you see the boss approaching while you're mid-drug deal

**Agency:**
- Player CHOOSES their path (legal grind, creative hustle, criminal empire)
- Player EARNS their success through skill (learning patterns, timing, positioning)
- Player OWNS their failures (got caught because I was greedy, not because RNG screwed me)
- Player FEELS SMART when they pull off risky moves successfully

**Consequence:**
- Choices have WEIGHT (getting fired means starting over, not just reloading)
- Relationships are FRAGILE (ignore your girlfriend, she leaves, you can't just apologize)
- Criminal record FOLLOWS YOU (can't just reset reputation, it's permanent)
- Success feels EARNED because failure was possible

**Realism:**
- The grind feels TEDIOUS (mopping floors is boring, that's the point)
- Money is HARD TO GET (can't get rich quick unless you take serious risks)
- Time is FINITE (working 80-hour weeks destroys relationships, just like real life)
- Opportunities have TRADE-OFFS (can't attend party AND make money, choose one)

---

## **SACRED DESIGN PILLARS** *(If iteration violates these, we've lost the vision)*

### **1. Environmental Awareness Over UI Hand-Holding**

**The Vision:**
Players develop REAL SKILLS in spatial awareness, pattern recognition, and timing. They FEEL like they're actually there, sneaking around, watching their surroundings.

**What This Means:**
- NO pop-up warnings ("Boss approaching!")
- NO quest markers pointing to safety
- NO autopilot features that do the thinking for you
- YES environmental cues (footsteps, shadows, visual tells)
- YES learnable patterns (boss walks by every 6 minutes)
- YES fair-but-unforgiving consequences (you COULD have seen him coming)

**The Test:**
*Does the player feel clever when they successfully avoid detection, or does the game just tell them when to hide?*

**If iteration adds:**
- Explicit warnings → **VIOLATION**
- Difficulty settings that add UI assists → **VIOLATION**
- Tutorials that over-explain → **VIOLATION**

**Acceptable iteration:**
- Better audio cues (clearer footsteps)
- More distinct visual tells (boss's shadow is more obvious)
- Improved camera controls (easier to glance around)

---

### **2. Simultaneous Multitasking Creates the Core Tension**

**The Vision:**
The game is NOT about choosing one activity at a time. It's about JUGGLING multiple activities simultaneously, managing attention, and accepting that you can't optimize everything.

**What This Means:**
- Player is PHYSICALLY in 3D space doing one thing
- Player can ACCESS devices (phone/computer) for other activities
- Multiple minigames can be RUNNING at once (not just paused)
- Attention is FINITE (can't give 100% to everything)
- Dropping one ball to catch another is EXPECTED

**The Test:**
*Does the player feel stressed trying to handle multiple things at once, like they're walking a tightrope?*

**If iteration adds:**
- Turn-based activity switching → **VIOLATION** (loses simultaneity)
- Unlimited attention (can do infinite things perfectly) → **VIOLATION**
- Autopilot features that "solve" activities for you → **VIOLATION**

**Acceptable iteration:**
- Better UI for quick-switching between activities
- Visual indicators of which activities need attention
- Skill progression that makes multitasking slightly easier (but never trivial)

---

### **3. Consequences Are Persistent and Systemic**

**The Vision:**
There is NO "undo" button on life. Choices cascade into lasting consequences. The game doesn't protect you from yourself. **But redemption is possible through serious, sustained effort - just like real life.**

**What This Means:**
- Getting FIRED means you lost that job (can't just reload save)
- Criminal RECORD affects your opportunities
  - **Minor offenses** (drug possession, DUI) can be expunged after years of clean living + legal fees
  - **Major offenses** (trafficking, violent crime) are PERMANENT, no way out
  - Expungement requires: time served + clean record period + money + legal process (tedious by design)
- Relationships that BREAK can be repaired
  - Requires MASSIVE effort (months of gifts, time investment, apologies, changed behavior)
  - So tedious most players won't bother (as intended - actions have weight)
  - But possible if player is truly committed to that relationship
- Jail TIME means you lose weeks/months (time skips forward, you miss rent, lose apartment, lose job)
- Debt is REAL (can't just ignore it, creditors pursue you)
- **Redemption paths exist but are HARD** (going from criminal to legitimate businessman takes years of grinding)

**The Test:**
*Does the player feel the weight of their decisions hours/days later? Can they eventually recover, but only through serious commitment?*

**Examples of Redemption:**
- Got arrested for dealing 2 years ago → stayed clean, paid lawyer, got record expunged → can now apply for corporate jobs
- Girlfriend left because you worked too much → spent 6 months attending every event, giving gifts, proving change → she gives you another chance
- Criminal empire collapsed → worked legal jobs for a year, saved money, started legitimate business → reinvented yourself

**Examples of Permanent Consequences:**
- Killed someone during botched deal → PERMANENT record, can never get government job, always flagged
- Betrayed family trust repeatedly → they cut contact, won't speak to you even after years
- Became notorious kingpin → even if you quit crime, reputation follows you forever

**If iteration adds:**
- "Forgive and forget" systems (reputation resets easily) → **VIOLATION**
- Save scumming as the expected strategy → **VIOLATION**
- Consequences that are purely cosmetic → **VIOLATION**

**Acceptable iteration:**
- Consequence severity tuning (maybe criminal record blocks SOME jobs, not all)
- Recovery paths that are hard but possible (rebuild relationship over months)
- Difficulty settings that adjust consequence harshness (but never eliminate them)

---

### **4. The Grind Is the Point**

**The Vision:**
Legal jobs are BORING because real jobs are boring. The tedium is what makes side hustles tempting. The game doesn't apologize for making you work.

**What This Means:**
- Legal jobs are SIMPLE, REPETITIVE, MINDLESS
- The satisfaction is MINIMAL (click spots, they disappear, small dopamine hit)
- The pay is LOW relative to effort (slow path to wealth)
- But they're SAFE (no risk of jail, stable income)
- The contrast makes RISKY activities feel exciting by comparison

**The Test:**
*After 20 minutes of mopping floors, does the player think "fuck this, I'm gonna sell drugs" (desired) or "this game is boring" (undesired)?*

**If iteration adds:**
- Making legal jobs too engaging (now they're competing with crime) → **VIOLATION**
- Auto-complete features (skips the grind) → **VIOLATION**
- "Fun" mini-games for every job (loses the tedium contrast) → **VIOLATION**

**Acceptable iteration:**
- Slight satisfaction improvements (better juice, sound effects)
- Skill-based bonuses (good players finish shifts faster)
- Variety within tedium (janitorial has 3 different simple tasks, not just one)

---

### **5. Multiple Paths Are Genuinely Viable**

**The Vision:**
There is NO "correct" way to play. Legal grind, creative hustle, criminal empire, mixed approach - all can lead to success. The game doesn't judge.

**What This Means:**
- A player who ONLY does legal work can become wealthy (slower but possible)
- A player who goes FULL CRIMINAL can succeed (risky but high reward)
- A player who BALANCES both can optimize (complex but rewarding)
- NPCs react DIFFERENTLY based on path (family proud vs disappointed)
- Success is DEFINED by the player (wealth? Status? Freedom? Relationships?)

**The Test:**
*Can a player choose ANY path and feel like they made the "right" choice for THEIR goals?*

**If iteration adds:**
- Obvious optimal path (everyone does crime because legal is pointless) → **VIOLATION**
- Moral judgment from the game itself (punishing crime beyond in-world consequences) → **VIOLATION**
- Gating content behind specific paths (must do crime to see half the game) → **VIOLATION**

**Acceptable iteration:**
- Balancing income rates (legal gets buff, crime gets nerf)
- More viable paths (creative path becomes third option)
- Hybrid strategies (launder money to look legit)

---

## **THE EMOTIONAL ARC WE WANT**

### **First 30 Minutes:**
- Curiosity ("Oh, I can walk around and interact with stuff")
- Discovery ("I can pull out my phone at work?")
- First risk ("Should I check this drug deal text?")
- First consequence ("Oh shit, boss almost caught me!")

**Player feels:** Excited, slightly stressed, engaged

---

### **First 5 Hours:**
- Mastery building ("I'm getting better at timing")
- Risk escalation ("I'm gonna try working two jobs at once")
- First major consequence ("Got fired, now what?")
- Path emergence ("I think I'm going to focus on crime")

**Player feels:** Challenged, invested, making meaningful choices

---

### **20+ Hours:**
- Systemic understanding ("I see how everything connects")
- Personal story ("My character is a corporate exec with a secret drug empire")
- Consequence accumulation ("My choices from hour 5 are still affecting me")
- Emergent gameplay ("I laundered drug money through my car wash, now IRS is investigating")

**Player feels:** Deeply engaged, telling their own story, emotionally invested

---

## **REFERENCE EXPERIENCES** *(When lost, remember these)*

### **Papers, Please**
- Tedious job (stamping passports) creates the grind
- Moral choices emerge from systems (feed family or follow rules?)
- Consequences persist (choices from day 1 affect day 30)
- **We want this:** Systemic moral pressure without explicit morality system

### **The Sims (What We're NOT)**
- Sims is domestic fantasy, we're economic struggle
- Sims is whimsical, we're grounded
- Sims punishes neglect (don't feed sim = death), we punish poor choices (get greedy = caught)
- **Difference matters:** We're not "life sim," we're "hustle sim"

### **GTA (What We Share, What We Don't)**
- Share: Freedom to be criminal, consequence systems, open paths
- Don't share: Combat focus, explicit violence, third-person shooter
- **We want:** Economic crime simulation, not action game

### **Stardew Valley (Surprisingly Relevant)**
- Time management (only so many hours in a day)
- Optimization tension (do I farm or mine or socialize?)
- Relationship maintenance costs time
- **We want:** This pressure but in urban hustle context

---

## **WHAT THIS GAME IS NOT** *(To prevent scope creep)*

**NOT:**
- A combat game (no shooting, fighting is rare/consequence not gameplay)
- A sandbox (focused experience, not infinite freedom)
- A story-driven game (emergent narrative, not scripted plot)
- A puzzle game (challenges come from systems, not designed levels)
- A competitive game (primarily single-player, MMO is future)

**IS:**
- A systems-driven life simulation
- An economic progression game
- A consequence-heavy decision simulator
- A multitasking management challenge
- A social dynamics sandbox

## **THE LITMUS TEST** *(Use this when iterating)*

Before implementing ANY feature or change, ask:

1. **Does this support multitasking tension?**
   - Yes → Consider it
   - No → Is it essential? If not, cut it

2. **Does this preserve player agency?**
   - Yes → Good
   - No → Redesign or cut

3. **Does this create meaningful consequence?**
   - Yes → Good
   - No → Make it consequential or cut

4. **Does this maintain the grind/reward balance?**
   - Yes → Good
   - Makes things too easy → Cut or tune
   - Makes things unfairly hard → Tune

5. **Is this true to the vision pillars?**
   - Yes to all → Ship it
   - Violates one → Redesign
   - Violates multiple → Cut it

---

## **WHEN YOU FEEL LOST** *(Return to this)*

**Symptoms of vision drift:**
- Adding features that don't serve the core loop
- Removing consequences to make game "friendlier"
- Hand-holding players instead of trusting them
- Chasing trends instead of the original vision
- Forgetting why the game was exciting in the first place

**The recovery process:**
1. Stop building new features
2. Re-read this vision document
3. Play your current build
4. Ask: "Does this still feel like the game I wanted to make?"
5. If no → cut features until it does
6. If yes → continue with renewed clarity

---

## **THE PROMISE TO YOURSELF**

**I will not:**
- Abandon the vision
